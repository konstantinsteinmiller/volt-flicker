// ─── GamePix portal-storage SaveStrategy ───────────────────────────────────
//
// `window.GamePix.localStorage` is the portal-side persistent store that
// survives toolkit-upload iframe-origin churn and syncs across devices
// for signed-in portal players. The v3 SDK does NOT intercept native
// `window.localStorage` writes — games must call `sdk.localStorage.X()`
// explicitly for data to survive. Without this strategy a GamePix build
// would silently fall back to native localStorage and lose progress on
// every fresh upload.
//
// Three properties make this strategy work:
//
//   1. **Boot-race write queue.** `SaveManager.init()` patches
//      `localStorage.setItem` BEFORE `gamepixPlugin()` calls
//      `sdk.init()`. On v3 the `sdk.localStorage` slot only goes live
//      AFTER `init()` resolves — so the first `onLocalSet` calls
//      (boot-time defaults flush, locale autodetect → setSettingValue,
//      a quick OptionsModal toggle) race against SDK init. We queue
//      every pending write in `dirty` (latest value per key wins) and
//      a 250 ms poll flushes them once `sdk.localStorage` becomes
//      reachable. The plugin also triggers an immediate `flush()` from
//      its boot block so the queue drains without waiting for the poll.
//
//   2. **Readback canary.** Outside a real player context (localhost,
//      dev server, developer QA tool when the player isn't signed in),
//      `sdk.localStorage.setItem` is a silent no-op — no throw, no
//      error, but `getItem` always returns null. The only way to
//      detect this is to read back after the first write. Logged once
//      per session so it isn't spammy.
//
//   3. **PORTAL_KEYS allowlist.** Only mirror the consolidated state
//      blob (`maw_state`), NOT internal-scratch keys or debug-only
//      flags. The latter should stay local-only by design — they
//      shouldn't roam across devices.
