// ─── Save Strategy contract ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The game uses the browser's synchronous `localStorage` as the source of
// truth at runtime — ~15 module-level reads fire during app bootstrap and
// many components write back on change. Each environment (plain web,
// CrazyGames, Glitch) layers a different *backend* on top of that local
// mirror to persist progress between devices.
//
// Rather than scatter build-flag branches through every call site, each
// backend is implemented as a `SaveStrategy`. `SaveManager` picks one at
// boot, hydrates localStorage from the backend, then forwards every
// subsequent local write to the strategy. Adding a new backend is a matter
// of implementing this one interface.

/**
 * Narrow accessor passed to strategies so they can read / write
 * localStorage without re-entering the SaveManager's mirror wrappers.
 * Strategies MUST use this instead of `window.localStorage` during
 * hydration, otherwise they'd trigger their own mirror recursively.

/**
 * Lifecycle of a strategy's hydrate path.

 *   pending          → hydrate hasn't started / hasn't completed yet
 *   success-with-data→ remote responded with data; merged into local
 *   success-empty    → remote *confirmed* it has no save data (NOT a network error)
 *   failed-retrying  → couldn't reach remote; background retry loop active
 *   failed-final     → retries exhausted; treat local as authoritative
 *
 * The crucial split is `success-empty` vs `failed-*`. The previous
 * version of the save system collapsed both into "no data, proceed",
 * which let a transient SDK error during boot wipe a player's progress
 * (the game would default to fresh state and the next autosave would
 * push those defaults to the cloud, overwriting the real save). This
 * type forces strategies to declare which one they observed.
