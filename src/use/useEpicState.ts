/**
 * Single-blob localStorage layer for Construct.
 *
 * EVERY persisted gameplay value the game touches lives inside ONE in-memory
 * record — `constructState` — and only ONE localStorage key is ever written:
 * `construct_state`. The cloud-sync subsystem (SaveManager / strategies) only
 * has to mirror this single key (plus the `__save_meta__` blob) for a complete
 * save. This keeps localStorage pollution minimal and makes cloud hydration a
 * single-object round-trip.
 *
 * Field names inside the record use the `epic_` prefix for game progress
 * (`epic_stage`, `epic_coins`, …). A handful of cross-cutting subsystems that
 * were reused wholesale from the Construct platform layer keep their original
 * `spinner_` field names (user settings, battle pass, daily rewards, the
 * ad-button cooldown) — these are now just keys INSIDE the one blob, not their
 * own localStorage entries, so there is no extra pollution.
 *
 * Writes are debounced (trailing edge, hard-capped) and hard-flushed on
 * `pagehide` / tab-hide so a close mid-burst never drops data.
