 *      (cancels the strategy's 250ms flush debounce).
 *
 * Use at hard checkpoints that MUST survive an immediate reload — chiefly a
 * level change. On the CrazyGames cloud-only build the `sdk.data` write is
 * async and only starts after the debounces elapse, so a player who clears a
 * stage and reloads a moment later lands back on the old stage. Starting the
 * push the instant the stage advances gives the cloud write the time it needs.
 * Fire-and-forget (`void`) so callers never block the UI on the network.
