// vConsole is shipped in EVERY build but only mounted on demand. The
// trigger is a hidden chord on the StageBadge: 25 taps within 60 seconds.
// Once mounted, an in-page "Hide" button tears it back down.
//
// Why every build (not just `isDebug`): the user is testing the
// CrazyGames mobile app on iPhone from a Windows machine — there's no
// remote Web Inspector path. They need a way to surface logs from a
// production-mode bundle on real demand. The chord is obscure enough
// that real users will never trigger it; opt-in cost for the developer
// is one tap-spam session.
//
// Why no `isMobilePortrait` gate: that gate combined `mobileCheck()` with
// `windowWidth.value <= 500`, and the width clause was unreliable inside
// wrapper-iframes (the CrazyGames mobile app, GameDistribution iframe,
// etc.) where `window.innerWidth` reflects the iframe size, not the
// device's logical width. 25 rapid clicks on a UI badge in <60s is so
// unusual on desktop that a hard gate isn't worth the false negatives
// it caused on iPhone QA flows.

// vConsole's library code is ~250KB gzipped — too heavy to live in
// the main bundle for a feature only invoked on demand. Solution:
// `main.ts` (which IS in the obfuscator's exclude list) installs a
// mounter function via `setVConsoleMounter`. The mounter does a
// `await import('vconsole')` from the safe zone — Rollup splits
// vConsole into its own chunk, only fetched when the chord fires
// or the URL trigger hits.
//
// This module no longer has a direct dependency on the vConsole
// library — keeps the main chunk's hot-path size down by ~250KB.
