// ─── Rewarded-ad throttle ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Caps rewarded video views at MAX_REWARDED inside a AD_WINDOW_MS rolling
// window per device. When throttled, `useAds` flips `isRewardedReady`
// false so the UI hides every reward button (RouletteWheel respin, 2x
// speed boost, AdRewardButton) — the same UX as a no-fill SDK state.
//
// Why per-device (localStorage), not per-account (cloud sync): this is
// an anti-abuse gate, not progress. Stored under the
// `__save_internal__` prefix so SaveManager skips forwarding it to the
// strategy — we don't want a player's watch budget travelling across
// devices.
//
// Why the periodic prune timer: `isRewardedThrottled` is a `computed`
// over a `ref` array, so it only re-evaluates when the array mutates.
// Without the pruning interval, a player who hits the cap and then
// idles for 10 minutes wouldn't see the reward button reappear until
// they triggered some other reactive write. The 60s prune cadence
// matches the resolution players actually perceive.
