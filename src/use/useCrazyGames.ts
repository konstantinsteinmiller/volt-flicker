// ─── CrazyGames SDK integration ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Encapsulates everything the rest of the app needs to talk to the
// CrazyGames SDK loaded via a <script> tag in index.html:
//
//   1. init() — probes `window.CrazyGames.SDK`, calls SDK.init(), and flips
//      `isSdkActive` to true iff the SDK reports a real CrazyGames environment
//      ('crazygames' for live iframe, 'local' for local dev tooling) AND the
//      build-time `isCrazyWeb` flag is set (VITE_APP_CRAZY_WEB=true).
//
//   2. Gameplay lifecycle — `startGameplay()` / `stopGameplay()` wrap the
//      SDK's `game.gameplayStart()` / `gameplayStop()` hooks, which let
//      CrazyGames know when the player is actually in a match (vs menus).
//
//   3. `showRewardedAd()` — a Promise-based wrapper around the SDK's
//      `ad.requestAd('rewarded', …)` callback API. Resolves `true` only when
//      the video played all the way through, so callers can safely grant the
//      reward on success and be silent on failure.
//
// Persistence of player progress is handled separately by
// `@/utils/save/CrazyGamesStrategy`, wired into `SaveManager` at boot. This
// module exposes `createCrazyGamesSaveStrategy()` so the bootstrap can pick
// that strategy without reaching into SDK internals itself.
//
// Outside of a CrazyGames build the module is inert: `isSdkActive` stays
// false and `showRewardedAd()` resolves false.
