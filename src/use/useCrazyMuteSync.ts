 * Direction of truth: the CG SDK is the source of truth for the mute
 * state — there's no public setter, the platform chrome owns it. We
 * listen for `sdk.game.addSettingsChangeListener` events (the v3
 * canonical API — the legacy `addMuteListener` never fires on the real
 * SDK) via `onCrazyMuteChange`, which also replays the current state to
 * the subscriber on attach, so one hook covers both the initial sync
 * and every subsequent toggle.
 *
 * We gate the *initial* apply on `isDbInitialized`: if IndexedDB hasn't
 * hydrated saved volume settings yet, we stash the pending mute and
 * apply it once hydration finishes so we don't fight the loader. Later
 * toggles flow through immediately.
