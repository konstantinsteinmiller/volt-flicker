// Provider-agnostic ad surface. Every platform-specific ad backend
// (CrazyGames SDK, Unity LevelPlay via the Tauri mobile plugin, etc.)
// implements this interface so the four in-game ad placements
// (midgame interstitial, AdRewardButton, RouletteWheel respin, 2x
// speed-boost reward) never have to know which provider is active.
//
// Three reactive readiness gates:
//   • `isReady`           — the SDK finished init AND we're in a build
//                           where ads are expected at all. Coarse gate
//                           kept for legacy callers.
//   • `isRewardedReady`   — a rewarded video is currently loaded and
//                           the next `showRewardedAd()` will play one.
//                           Drives v-if on AdRewardButton, the roulette
//                           respin button, and the 2x speed-boost
//                           switch — anything offering a rewarded ad.
//   • `isInterstitialReady` — an interstitial is currently loaded.
//                             Used to gate the midgame battle-cadence
//                             ad so we don't pause gameplay only to
//                             fall back to "no fill".
//
// Per-format readiness flips false the moment an ad is consumed (or
// fails to load) and flips back true on the next `onAdLoaded` event
// from the native SDK. This is what guarantees buttons disappear when
// inventory runs out — exactly what we want for a kids app where
// stale "watch ad" prompts that do nothing are user-hostile.
//
// Contract notes:
//   • `showRewardedAd` resolves `true` only if the video played all the
//     way through — callers grant the reward only on `true`.
//   • `showMidgameAd` resolves when the interstitial finished or
//     errored. It never rejects: callers `await` it and resume gameplay.
//   • `init` is idempotent and safe to call when the provider is inert
//     (e.g. Noop on unsupported platforms).
