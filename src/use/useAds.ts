// live.
//
// Provider selection:
//   • `isCrazyWeb` build        → CrazyGames SDK (gate also requires
//                                  `isCrazyGamesFullRelease` inside the
//                                  provider)
//   • `isGameDistribution` build → GameDistribution.com SDK
//   • `showMediatorAds && isNative` → Unity LevelPlay (Tauri plugin)
//   • everything else           → Noop (ads UI hidden, calls inert)
//
// The CrazyGames SDK is still initialised directly from `main.ts` — it
// has to run before the SaveManager hydrates. LevelPlay and GameDistribution
// init happen after mount via `initAds()` — LevelPlay because the native
// side needs the Android Activity / iOS ViewController to be alive,
// GameDistribution because the SDK script is dynamically injected and we
// don't want to pay that latency on the boot critical path.
