// Background SFX preload — fires AFTER first paint so it never competes
// with the critical path.
//
// Without this, every SFX pays its first-play decode cost the moment the
// game fires it (grass-cut #1 stutters on the first mow, the chain-loop
// silences for a beat on round start). The decode is cheap individually
// (1-5 ms per .ogg) but happens in a flurry of small bursts during the
// opening seconds of gameplay — exactly when the player is forming a
// first impression. Decoding everything once, on an idle callback,
// pushes that work off the rendering thread before it gets noticed.
//
// `loadAudioBuffer` is idempotent — repeat calls hit the cache or join
// the pending decode promise, so it's safe to call this preload more
// than once (e.g. on every MawScene mount). The visibility-hidden /
// ad-show suspend system in `useAssets.ts` doesn't affect decode — it
// only gates playback — so this works correctly even if the tab is
// backgrounded during preload.

// Every SFX the gameplay scene can fire. Kept as a flat list so a single
// allSettled covers them all. Order doesn't matter — they decode in
// parallel and fight for the AudioContext's decoder pool. Adding a new
// SFX = add the basename here (no `.ogg`, no path prefix).
