// ─── Mobile-only hard audio mute ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// On a phone the OS volume rocker controls the device output level; the Web
// Audio GainNode the desktop volume slider drives has no audible effect there.
// So the on-screen FMuteButton can't usefully "turn the volume down" on mobile.
// Players still want a way to silence the game (to play their own music in a
// separate app), so on mobile the button is a hard SILENCE toggle instead:
//
//   • suspends the shared AudioContext + pauses every tracked HTMLAudio
//     (the bg music) via the ref-counted `suspendAllAudio`, and
//   • blocks any NEW music start (`playWithFade` early-returns while muted) and
//     any NEW one-shot SFX (`playSound`/`playLoop` already refuse to start while
//     `isAudioSuspended()` is true), and
//   • hard-stops in-flight one-shots so nothing tails / resumes on unmute.
//
// It owns its OWN ref-counted suspend slot — independent of the pause-gate slot
// (`useGamePauseAudio`) and the portal soundOff slot — so it composes with ads /
// tab-hide without drifting the suspend counter (an ad firing while muted nests
// to depth 2 and unwinds back to the mute's depth 1, never to 0).
//
// Distinct from the DESKTOP volume-mute (`useCrazyMuteSync`), which zeroes the
// stored volumes and is the right model where Web Audio gain works. This flag is
// only ever true on mobile; on desktop it stays false so desktop audio (and the
// `playWithFade` guard) are untouched even if a synced save carries a mobile mute.
