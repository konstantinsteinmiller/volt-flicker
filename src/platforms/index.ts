// ─── Platform registry ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Aggregates the per-platform modules under `src/platforms/<name>/index.ts`
// and exposes the active one based on Vite env flags. Each module is
// statically imported here ONLY for its `platform` descriptor (id, envFlag,
// capabilities). The actual heavy implementations (strategies, providers,
// composables) are still resolved lazily by `resolveSaveStrategy` /
// `resolveAdProvider` so non-active platforms tree-shake cleanly.
//
// Adding a new platform:
//   1. Create `src/platforms/<name>/index.ts` exporting `{ platform: { id, envFlag, capabilities } }`.
//   2. Append the platform to `ALL_PLATFORMS` below.
//   3. Add an arm to `resolveSaveStrategy` if it has a save backend.
//   4. Add an arm to `resolveAdProvider` if it has ads.
//   5. Add an arm to `buildCsp` (`src/platforms/csp.ts`) if it needs special CSP.
//
// `useUser.ts`, `main.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, and `App.vue` no longer
// branch on individual platform flags — they consume capabilities and
// resolved providers from this layer instead.
